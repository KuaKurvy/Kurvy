<p>"Komhay"<font size=7>My name is Tano, Julian Kurvy born in 9TH of the month or 6th day of September born  in Quezon City I guess it’s in Manila raised in province of Quezon City I live at different country every 2 year I guess because my mom is working out of the country. When I was a kid I don’t remember such things but everytime mom tellsme about how nouthy I am when I was a kid and  picture with her.  I am a honor student from daycare, kinder garden, grade 1 but when I went to Bucaue Bulacan at Turo Elementary school i was bullied back then every time i enter at school someone throwing books at me, chairs etc. I remember back then one time I saw my uniform full of blood of my own, my mom went at school that time and we turned back at Quezon City to continue my study I don’t even remember if I repeat school year I guess I wasn’t.</p>

<p>2nd grade my mom started  to train me  taekwondo  for self defense our training are hard as hell because I am  grade 2 that time, but after days and days of training I start to like it until it become my favourite sports other than soccer and basketball, then we went to Rizal for me to study there,  grade 3 student and  suddenly I wasn’t expect to become  2nd honor that year and after that year we returned to Quezon City where  our house really is and study for 4th grade and honor that year after that, in my 5th grade my mom left me at my step father in Bucaue Bulacan where I was get bullied back then. I saw my old classmates and they’re amaze when they recognized me they  are still so trouble makers but not as like when were  at 2nd grade . after saying that I trained taekwondo to defend my self they said sorry about what happened when were 2nd grade and they won’t do it again maybe that’s because I warned them hehe. But because of that I belong on them not as trouble makers but as a lazy students I didn’t get a award that time because I spent my days at playing outside with my friends but at 6th grade  I almost got a award because I am a good student, well that’s my teacher said   because me and my classmate  helped  them every time we saw them carrying their bags and that year is the year  of mine joining in the compete in essay and taekwondo I only the 11th place of essay writing in almost 150 students and at taekwondo let me tell you my story of taekwondo tournament at Bulacan.</p>

<p>            As I say I trained taekwondo when I was a kid so I had experience at taekwondo but not in a competition my teacher told me to join at taekwondo for a grade and for me because they know that I am a taekwondo player and I agreed then it start without any training in almost 2 years. Our bus is arrived and our teacher to come inside and she said don’t be so nervous , I’ve got a little excited when were still on a bus but when we arrived at central I barely even walk my feet and my friend/classmate who’s also join at taekwondo  compete he grab my hand and we went at the taekwondo facilities, in were at almost 250 person in 1 room, yeah I know they’re many in first challenge is exercise without knowing that our coach and other person  is going to remove those not fit in, like example  in 45 kick if they can’t do regular 45 kick they will be removed we trained 45kick, 75kick, roundhouse kick, full house kick at the same rules process until we went down up to  50person when the contestant went down to 50 they suddenly change the process into 1v1 sparring I don’t know but I fought in 6 players first when I already in the circle of battleground I was so very nervous I don’t even know how do I win that fight same as 3 players but in 5th fight suddenly my opponent was a girl same old as me I didn’t hit her that much but suddenly i won. But on the last round my opponent was my classmate /a guy my nervous is back again I’ve got a hot feeling like my body boiled. I didn’t expect on what happened that fight because when our coach said ready to fight I change my footwork and turn to left and when our coach start and drop the white flag that represent the starting. I suddenly did a round house kick and I kick his face and he cried I though he was only a cry baby but when our coach look at him they saw a blood at his face or on his mouth to be exact I thought I was  gonna be suspended because on what I did but my coach calls my name and he said  good job I finished my opponent in 1 kick and a short period of time and he put me in the winner vounch don’t get me wrong we had a protective  gear that time on head, private part and hand gloves then I went back to our school for a afternoon classes I told them that I was picked and they are happy that day and we don’t had teacher that time at our room that’s why we play a wrestling they grab my neck, I can’t move that’s why I forced my self to grab the closest chair on me and I suddenly did a turning back kick at my classmate and after that he cried  he said he barely cant breathe that why I suddenly realized that I hit him on his neck I though I was gonna be suspended twice but after a moment he recovered and act like nothing he still my friend after all  but my self felt bad for him. after that day  our coach calls us and said our fight in other country is on next month so we’ve better to practice at his gym slightly close at our house . after days of days on training my mom didn’t let me to fight at the tournament because my mom is on Saudi Arabic that time. And because our coach told us to stay at his gym for a month to practice /training and that’s the reason why my mom didn’t let me to join that fight.</p>
